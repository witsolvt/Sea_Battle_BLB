Hi there! 
I wanted to recreate a game from my childhood I used to play in school on my free time. 
It actuaally is really fun and unxepectedly diverse in a matter of startegies.
So I hope you will enjoy it :)
Normally it is played on paper, which means you need to draw a field from the beggining all the time.
Of course it is annoying, so my program resolvses that and makes possible to play with a bot, not only real human.

Enjoy the battle, captain!
