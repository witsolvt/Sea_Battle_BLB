Hi there! I wanted to recreate a game from my childhood that I used to play in school during my free time. It actually is really fun and unexpectedly diverse in terms of strategies. So I hope you will enjoy it :)

Normally, it is played on paper, which means you need to draw the field from the beginning every time. Of course, this is annoying, so my program resolves that and makes it possible to play with a bot, not only with another human.

Enjoy the battle, captain!



To compile and start a game you need to install ncurses library:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

And compile the file with this command
  g++ main.cpp -lncurses
